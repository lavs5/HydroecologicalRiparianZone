## Scripts
Scripts for extracting hydrological and ecological factors influencing riparian zones, utilizing Sentinel Imagery through Google Earth Engine (GEE).

### 1. [Flood.js](Scripts/flood.js)
This script identifies seasonal flooding extents using Sentinel-1 satellite imagery and references established methodologies.

#### **Script Functionality**
1. Utilizes **Sentinel-1 GRD Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)** data to identify **seasonally flooded** areas.
2. Calculates indices, including:  
   - Ratio Index (**RI**)  
   - Normalized Difference Flood Index (**NDFI**)  
   - Difference Image Index (**DII**)
3. Converts flood masks into polygons and calculates the area of flooded pixels.
4. Visualizes the flood extent on a map and exports flood polygons to **Google Drive**.

### 2. [Veg.js](Scripts/veg.js)
This script identifies dense vegetation extents using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and vegetation spectral indices.


#### **Script Functionality**

1. Utilizes **Sentinel-2 multispectral** satellite imagery to detect **dense vegetation** extent.
2. Calculates four spectral indices:
    - Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (**NDVI**)
    - Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (**GNDVI**)
    - Enhanced Vegetation Index (**EVI**)
    - Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (**SAVI**)
3. Normalizes the indices and thresholds to identify dense vegetation pixels.
4. Identifies connected components of more than 5 pixels to reduce noise.
5. Calculates the area of dense vegetation pixels detected by each index.
6. Visualizes results on the map and exports the dense vegetation polygons as GeoJSON files to Google Drive.
7. Refers examples from the Google Earth Engine Help Documentation.

### 3. [Soil.js](Scripts/soil.js)
This script identifies hydric soils extents using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and soil spectral indices.


#### **Script Functionality**

1. Utilizes **Sentinel-2 multispectral** satellite imagery to detect **hydric soils** extent.
2. Calculates three spectral indices:
    - Simple Ratio (**SR**)
    - Difference Vegetation Index (**DVI**)
    - Clay Mineral Ratio (**CMR**)
3. Normalizes the indices and thresholds to identify hydric soils pixels.
4. Creates masks to exclude pixels in perennial waterbodies.
5. Calculates the area of hydric soils pixels detected by each index.
6. Visualizes results on the map and exports the hydric soils polygons as GeoJSON files to Google Drive.
7. Refers examples from the Google Earth Engine Help Documentation.

2. Uses Supervised Classification Algorithms (CART, RF, SVM) to classify the image
3. Calculates NDVI and NDWI indices & appends to image to be used for classification
4. Calculates accuracy metrics for each classifier and selects the best classifier
5. Vectorizes the classified image into polygons for each class
6. Visualizes results on the map and exports the classified polygons as GeoJSON files to Google Drive.
7. Refers examples from the Google Earth Engine Help Documentation.
